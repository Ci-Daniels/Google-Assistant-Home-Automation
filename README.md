# Google-Assistant-Home-Automation
Google Assistant is an AI(Artificial Intelligence) based voice command service. It can be used to schedule, control or even plan events remotely. This can be used to control home appliances using voice.  I have employed the use of Google Assistant, IFTTT, and adafruit platforms to perform the task of switching my lights on and off.
