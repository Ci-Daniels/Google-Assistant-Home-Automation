# Google-Assistant-Home-Automation
Google Assistant is an AI(Artificial Intelligence) based voice command service. It can be used to schedule, control or even plan events remotely. This can be used to control home appliances using voice.  I have employed the use of Google Assistant, IFTTT, and adafruit platforms to perform the task of switching my lights on and off.## PROJECT STATEMENT
The need for safe health practices such as using sanitizers after using public amenities like taps,doors or switches is very essential to reduce  spread of COVID-19. Therefore there is an immediate need in the innovation involving touch free triggers to facilitate actions such as activating taps, doors and switches.
